<h1>welcome to fountainfinder</h1>
<h2><b>our goal</b></h2>
<p>our goal is to create a publicly accessable and editable comprehensive map of both public and proprietary<br>
water sources across the world, so that anyone can find water. Whether this be a student looking for <br>a source of good water in their school,
or a hiker trying to find the nearest spigot to avoid dehydration, or someone living in an urban area<br>
looking for a public faucet.</p>

<h2><b>how to read this map</b></h2>
<p>This map consists of a background map of your building, overlaid with dots corresponding to water sources. <br>
The average quality as recently reported is reflected in the tone of the dot, ranging from green to yellow to red from best to worst.<br>
The "filter level", if the fountain has a bottle filler, will be noted in the color placed in the top right corner of the dot.<br>
Non-functional fountains are represented by an empty grey circle. The floor can be selected with the drop-down in the top left.</p>

<h2><b>how to contribute</b></h2>
<p>leave a quantitave review by ranking the fountain's quality from 0-10 after clicking on it.<br>
you may also add a new fountain if you wish by requesting a trusted representative of the building to add one<br>
with the "contribute" button below the map. If you wish to add your building to our network, <br>
public software to host your personal fountainfinder will be avaliable soon.</p>
